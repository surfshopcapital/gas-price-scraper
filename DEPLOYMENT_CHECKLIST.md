## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Two-Service Setup (Current Configuration)
You have **two separate Railway services** from the same repository:

#### Service 1: Gas Scraper (Background Service) - **UPDATED TO PLAYWRIGHT**
- **Configuration**: `railway.json` + `nixpacks.toml`
- **Purpose**: Runs continuously, scraping gas price data using Playwright
- **Start Command**: `python run_scraper.py`
- **Dependencies**: **Playwright + Chromium**, PostgreSQL, all Python packages

#### Service 2: Web Dashboard (Web Service)
- **Configuration**: `railway_dashboard.json` + `nixpacks_dashboard.toml`
- **Purpose**: Provides web interface for viewing scraped data
- **Start Command**: `streamlit run dashboard.py`
- **Dependencies**: Lightweight, no browser dependencies needed

### Deployment Steps
1. **Deploy Scraper Service**:
   - Railway will use `railway.json` → `nixpacks.toml`
   - **NEW**: Playwright will install Chromium browser automatically
   - Service runs in background, scraping data continuously

2. **Deploy Dashboard Service**:
   - Railway will use `railway_dashboard.json` → `nixpacks_dashboard.toml`
   - Service provides web interface accessible via URL

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

### Scraper Service
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NONINTERACTIVE=1` - For headless operation

### Dashboard Service
- `PORT` - Railway will set this automatically
- `DATABASE_URL` - Same database for viewing data

## 📊 Monitoring Deployment

### Scraper Service - **UPDATED FOR PLAYWRIGHT**
1. **Check Build Logs**: Ensure Playwright and Chromium install correctly
2. **Check Runtime Logs**: Look for Playwright startup messages
3. **Verify Database Connection**: Should see "✅ DB OK @ [timestamp]"
4. **Monitor Scraping Jobs**: Should see Playwright-based job execution logs

### Dashboard Service
1. **Check Build Logs**: Ensure Python packages install correctly
2. **Check Runtime Logs**: Look for Streamlit startup messages
3. **Verify Web Access**: Should be accessible via Railway URL
4. **Test Database Connection**: Should display scraped data

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions - **UPDATED FOR PLAYWRIGHT**

### **NEW**: Playwright Not Found Error
- **Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'playwright'`
- **Solution**: ✅ Fixed - Added `playwright>=1.40.0` to requirements.txt
- **Solution**: ✅ Fixed - Added `playwright install chromium` to Nixpacks

### **NEW**: Chromium Browser Not Installed
- **Issue**: Playwright can't find Chromium browser
- **Solution**: ✅ Fixed - Nixpacks runs `playwright install chromium` automatically

### **UPDATED**: Browser Stability Issues
- **Issue**: Browser crashes or disconnections
- **Solution**: ✅ Fixed - Playwright is more stable than Selenium in cloud environments
- **Solution**: ✅ Fixed - Fresh browser context per job strategy

### **UPDATED**: Memory Issues
- **Issue**: High memory usage
- **Solution**: ✅ Fixed - Playwright has better memory management than Selenium
- **Solution**: ✅ Fixed - Contexts are properly closed after each job

### Dashboard Issues
- ✅ Lightweight configuration for web service
- ✅ No browser dependencies
- ✅ Proper Streamlit configuration

## 🎯 Expected Behavior - **UPDATED FOR PLAYWRIGHT**

### After Scraper Deployment:
1. ✅ **NEW**: Playwright package installed successfully
2. ✅ **NEW**: Chromium browser installed by Playwright
3. ✅ Database connection established
4. ✅ **NEW**: Playwright browser setup successful
5. ✅ Scraping jobs running on schedule using Playwright
6. ✅ Data being saved to PostgreSQL
7. ✅ **NEW**: No more DevTools disconnection errors (Playwright handles this better)

### After Dashboard Deployment:
1. ✅ Streamlit service started successfully
2. ✅ Web interface accessible via Railway URL
3. ✅ Database connection for viewing data
4. ✅ Real-time data display

## 🔄 Update Process

When you push updates:
1. **Scraper Service**: Railway automatically rebuilds using `railway.json` → `nixpacks.toml`
2. **Dashboard Service**: Railway automatically rebuilds using `railway_dashboard.json` → `nixpacks_dashboard.toml`
3. **NEW**: Playwright and Chromium are automatically installed
4. **NEW**: Enhanced Playwright-based scraping takes effect
5. **NEW**: All scraping jobs use fresh browser context strategy
6. **NEW**: Better stability and anti-detection features are active

## 📝 Key Changes Made

### **Migration from Selenium to Playwright**:
- ✅ **Replaced**: Selenium WebDriver with Playwright
- ✅ **Replaced**: ChromeDriver with Playwright's built-in Chromium
- ✅ **Replaced**: Selenium-specific error handling with Playwright error handling
- ✅ **Added**: Anti-detection features for better scraping success
- ✅ **Added**: Fresh browser context per job for stability

### **Dependencies Updated**:
- ✅ **Added**: `playwright>=1.40.0` to requirements.txt
- ✅ **Added**: `playwright-browser-chromium>=1.40.0` to requirements.txt
- ✅ **Added**: `playwright install chromium` to Nixpacks build process

### **Configuration Updated**:
